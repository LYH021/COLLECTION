I think that a very static template cannot define a place suitable for living. Some people believe that living in a larger space is very comfortable, and a smaller space will make people feel tense. Some people think that a small distance makes people feel more secure than ample space. I like small and compact spaces, and I enjoy the satisfaction of observing every corner of my home at once.

And I think that a long-term living environment often needs to change the interior constantly. For example, the sofa in the home can be changed from time to time, so that 
people resting on it can get a different experience than the original.

On the other hand, the number of people living will also change according to different needs. Some families have three people, and some have four people. According to various family situations, their needs for the living environment will also change.

So, on the whole, I think an ideal house should be changeable and customizable. The size and function of a home can be flexibly changed according to the needs of each family.
