In Wellington, there are many contradictions surrounding the theme of housing in various aspects.

In Wellington, there are many contradictions surrounding the theme of housing in various aspects. One of the contradictions is the housing crisis. With the Wellington Railway Station as the center, the housing area to the north is mostly low-income families. The housing area is denser, which leads to land shortage, making new housing more expensive and beyond the range of low-income families. Office areas and factories are mostly concentrated in the south of the railway station. Because the housing area near the railway station is a wealthy area, the housing price is very high, and the characteristics of the station location of the railway station, the division of the north and south areas is very serious, making the purchase of houses and living pressure of local residents gradually increase, and gradually Exacerbate local housing anxiety and social conflicts.
Based on this background, our design project mainly intends to conduct research and design around the housing crisis, space utilization, space optimization, environmental maintenance and other aspects.
When selecting the site, taking into account the local land use factor, we believe that conventional urban space utilization cannot perfectly solve all the problems we found, such as the creation of parasitic buildings that cannot simultaneously solve the housing problem and the problem of space division in the region. According to the characteristics of the terrain, what we envision is to use the space that cannot be used in the process of conventional urban expansion, and to break the split space created by the original road without occupying the conventional urban space problem. Therefore, we choose the sky above the train tracks as our site.
The functional areas of our project are housing area, commercial area, office area and education area. Taking into account the possibility of reuse of buildings and future variability, we have created each large area under the basic steel framework. These large basic areas are as a large unit and all small units are grouped together, and small units can be added or reduced according to future needs, so as to adjust the transformation of regional functions to adapt to the regional environmental and economic conditions. Balanced areas Contradictions promote regional economic development.
The base of the building can also function as a bridge that spans the entire train track, unites the independent roads on both sides of the train track, and connects the areas on both sides into a whole. Due to the particularity of the location, it can play a role in connecting the traffic between the south and the north, and the geographical features of the seaside can also provide good scenery and light for high-rise residential areas.



After our investigation on the local housing problems in Wellington, we found that the local land use situation is relatively tense. On the one hand, it is difficult for the city to plan new housing areas and the housing prices continue to rise. On the other hand, it also leads to middle-class families. There is no way to afford a new house. Therefore, around these rich areas in the Wellington train station area as the center, close to the north is an area where the middle class gathers. There are more jobs in the south, and most cities
