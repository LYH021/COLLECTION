This time in the school's REPRESENTATION Class, the teacher asked our students to put forward their own three statements.
We can say that, it's a chance to pre ourselves. I personally think that I am quite thoughtful, of course it is limited to my own thoughts. So, I am very passionate about this assignment.



#9M IS ENOUGH

In my personal opinion, in the city. The range that people can perceive is only nine meters away in the vertical direction. This distance is approximately equal to the height of a three-story building, and it is also the max distance at which people can easily perceive the changes in the facades of different buildings.

This point of view was discovered when I was looking for material in the city. In cities, buildings are usually very tall, especially in Chinese cities. The symbol of a city is usually a building or a group of buildings. Although we can easily identify different buildings from various renderings. However, when we actually walk into these buildings, it is actually difficult for us to distinguish the essential differences between the landmark buildings in different cities. No matter how good the facades of shopping malls in different cities are, the internal experience will not make you feel that you are in a very different space. Because all the shopping malls in China are the same, there is no difference.

I think this point of view can also be extended to many current architectural exhibitions. For example, Daxing International Airport in Beijing, all media are exaggerating how excellent and spectacular this airport is. But what about actually being there? Due to the huge scale, I don't think visitors can see anything except the base of the building. I don't know why the current architectural propaganda likes to use bird's-eye rendering videos for publicity. This is a complete fraud, as no one will be able to observe the building from this perspective.

This out-of-scale design is a fraud.



#LESS IS MORE

I know this is plagiarism hhhh. But in fact, my point of view is somewhat different from the traditional one. The expression is consistent but the content is not the same, I think this can be used as a reason.

LESS IS MORE, what I want to say is, try to use fewer things and create more things. Just like my collage, a very complex spatial relationship is created through a few lines. This is my longing and pursuit.

If in the future I can use a wall to separate the 3D and 4D worlds, I think my mission is done. (JUST A JOCK)



#BUILDING IS NOT ARCHITECTURE

In my opinion, there is a very fundamental difference between ARCHITECTURE and BUILDING. It's a bit like the difference between a passport photo and an oil painting. ARCHITECTURE is a product of creativity. I don't think it needs to be very practical, but it must be exploratory. As an industrialized product, BUILDING puts practicality first, but artistry does not necessarily need it.

The two cannot be compared with each other, just like my collage. The caravan, which is an industrial product, is equipped with pillars representing architecture, bucket arches, and stoves. It seems that it satisfies both art and practicality, but in fact, it is neither fish nor fowl.

What makes me firm in this idea is the 2022 China Ugliest Architecture Awards Conference.
Among them, the first place is Shanghai's 1000 Trees which is designed by Heatherwick Studio. Because I think this is an experimental ARCHITECTURE, I can understand that some people will not like this kind of architecture. But I think it's an insult to compare this building with other industrial junk BUILDINGs, and doesn't need to tell it won the worst prize.
